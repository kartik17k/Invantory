# Inventory
A new Flutter project for managing inventory efficiently.

## Features
1. Automatic Product Identification
Scans the QR code on the product to automatically extract the product ID.
Eliminates the need for manual input, ensuring faster and error-free product identification.
2. Seamless Camera Integration
   Opens the device camera for scanning directly within the app.
   Uses a clean and intuitive UI to make scanning simple and user-friendly.
3. Instant Retrieval of Product Details
   After scanning the QR code, the app fetches the corresponding product details.
   Displays information like:
   Product name
   Description
   Inventory date
   Supervisor
   Current stock
   Ensures a smooth user experience with real-time data display.
4. Fallback to Manual Entry
   Allows users to switch between QR code scanning and manual entry for flexibility.
   Useful in cases where QR codes are damaged or unavailable.
5. Efficient Inventory Management
   Perfect for warehouse environments where products are tagged with QR codes.
   Speeds up operations like stock checking, updating inventory, and reordering.
6. Cross-Platform Compatibility
   Works on both Android and iOS devices using Flutter‚Äôs cross-platform capabilities.
   Uses a QR code scanning library like qr_code_scanner for high performance.
7. Offline and Online Modes
   Offline: Fetch product details from a local database (e.g., SQLite).
   Online: Retrieve product details from a remote server or cloud database (e.g., Firebase, MySQL).
8. Customizable QR Codes
   QR codes can store additional data, like location or batch numbers, depending on the app's needs.
   Enables future scalability for advanced features.
9. Error Handling and Validation
   Notifies the user if the QR code is invalid or the product ID is not found in the database.
   Provides helpful feedback for smoother usability.
10. User-Friendly Interaction
    Minimalistic design ensures that even non-technical users can operate the app effectively.
    Provides visual or haptic feedback upon successful scanning.
